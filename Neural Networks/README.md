# Python-Neural-Network-Exercises

A series of exercises (cases) solving neural network problems using Python.
All exercises have been done in a team, consisting of Eric Ker√§nen, Samuel Aitamaa & Teemu Luhtanen.

## Case 00

- Tensorflow MNIST dataset
- Training a model
- Finding the simplest way to solve the exercise with relatively good accuracy

## Case 01

- Creating the first neural network
- Splitting the data into training, validation and test sets
- Training a neural network
- Validating a neural network
- Evaluating the final metrics using a test set
- Using various libraries to achieve the goal
