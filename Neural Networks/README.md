# Python-Neural-Network-Exercises

A series of exercises (cases) solving neural network problems using Python.

## Case 00

- Tensorflow MNIST dataset
- Training a model
- Finding the simplest way to solve the exercise with relatively good accuracy

> Contributor(s): Eric Ker채nen

## Case 01

- Binary classification
- Creation of neural network models
- Splitting the data into training, validation and test sets
- Data normalization
- Class weights
- Training a neural network (hidden layers / neurons)
- Validating a neural network
- Evaluating the final metrics using a test set
- Confusion matrix evaluation
- Using various libraries to achieve the goal

- Reassembling the datasets to be more fair
- Data / Image augmentation
- Three different models
- Training said models and
- Evaluating said models
- Printing out images
- Evaluating plots, confusion matrices and classification reports
- Finding information from other authors
